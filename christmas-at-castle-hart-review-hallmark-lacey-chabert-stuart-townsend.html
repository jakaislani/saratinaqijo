<time>06 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Spoilers for 'Christmas at Castle Hart'</strong></p><p>The Christmas season is just around the corner and <a title=Hallmark href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hallmark</a> has already started treating its viewers with heart-warming stories on its network. As soon as the network announced the list of movies that were going to get released during this holiday season, fans were really excited to know about these projects. One such movie that nabbed all the eyeballs was none other than ‘<a title="Christmas at Castle Hart" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas at Castle Hart</a>’.</p><p>The movie revolves around a woman named Brooke (<a title="Lacey Chabert" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lacey Chabert</a>) who has recently been fired from her waitressing job and is now looking for another one. However, her impetuous sister Margot (Ali Hardiman) convinces her to go on a holiday before they get busy with their jobs. The duo goes for a vacation to Ireland and gets to know more about their Irish roots. But everything changes when Brooke meets the person that she has adored for a very long time. When they arrive, Brooke meets Aiden Hart in the local pub and soon discovers that he’s, in fact, the Earl of Glaslough (Stuart Townsend).</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a title="'A Christmas Together With You': 5 things to know about the romantic Hallmark movie" href=# rel>'A Christmas Together With You': 5 things to know about the romantic Hallmark movie&nbsp;</a></p><p><a title="'Next Stop, Christmas': 5 things to know about Hallmark yuletide flick" href=# rel>'Next Stop, Christmas': 5 things to know about Hallmark yuletide flick</a></p><p><br>Aiden believes that they are high-profile event players from New York and asks them to host a luxurious party. Will she be able to do everything without Aiden knowing her reality? That’s the primary focus of <a title="Hallmark’s Christmas movie" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hallmark’s Christmas movie</a> and I must tell you that ‘Christmas at Castle Hart’ is undoubtedly one of the sweetest Christmas gifts that fans could expect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/92cb22db-272c-488f-a3bb-52db13f8c2c7.png><p>The movie moves forward with Aiden believing that Brooke is actually Paige Monahan, one of the biggest party planners in the USA, and he could use her help in throwing a party that he and her sister Siobhan has planned for the Duchess of Abercorn (Kate O’Toole). Brooke takes up the challenge and starts working on the event. During the process, Aiden and Brooke fall in love with each other. Unfortunately, the real Paige Monahan (Donna Anita Nikolaisen) gets to know the truth and flies back to Ireland in order to see why these two women are using her name to manage such a big event.</p><p>The best thing about the movie is that it is not an over-the-top romantic movie in which the leading actors are doing a lot of cheesy things to impress each other. The simplicity of these characters makes this a wonderful watch and even though you know that Brooke is lying to Aiden, you root for her because she’s doing to make Aiden and her sister feel better. The Hallmark Christmas romance is a light and warming watch that is just perfect for this cold season.</p><p>In the end, just as hope was lost and goodbyes were said, happiness rears its head once more when Aiden gives Brooke another chance, making for a very happy and toasty warm ending.</p><p>Lacey Chabert and Stuart Townsend look perfect with each other and made a really good pair. The camaraderie between them is the highlight of the movie and whenever they share a frame in the movie, we know something magical is going to take place. Chabert has once again shown why she is the “Queen of Hallmark Christmas Movie”. She is so effortless while playing Brooke and gives another majestic performance that will be remembered by fans for a long, long time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/4345bc27-338a-45cf-b21c-1f3859c4e331.jpg><p>Meanwhile, Townsend is brilliant as Aiden. ‘Christmas at Castle Hart’ is Townsend’s debut movie with Hallmark and it’s certainly not the lost one. However, it is Ali Hardiman who takes your heart away with her role of Margot. The actress does a phenomenal job and tickles our funny bones with great comedic timing. I hope, we get to see her in a lot of projects in near future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/f4cde1f8-9387-456a-981c-0e29b6f44295.jpg><p>‘Christmas at Castle Hart’ is a charming movie filled with a lot of exciting moments and heart-warming scenes. In the spirit of Christmas, we recommend you to get together with your loved ones and give this movie a watch as it won’t disappoint you. It will also tell you that sometimes lying can be useful as well if it gives your partner everything that he or she ever wanted. This movie is all about love and love is all we need right now.</p><p>‘Christmas at Castle Hart’ is available to watch on Hallmark Channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRom5intrTAzJqqZpmkYrCiv9OlnGagkafBbr7Er6Cer12drq24zJqppGWclrCmxYycn5qalafBbr%2FTrpirrF2pvLi60p6lnQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchristmas-at-castle-hart-review-hallmark-lacey-chabert-stuart-townsend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchristmas-at-castle-hart-review-hallmark-lacey-chabert-stuart-townsend.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchristmas-at-castle-hart-review-hallmark-lacey-chabert-stuart-townsend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchristmas-at-castle-hart-review-hallmark-lacey-chabert-stuart-townsend.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchristmas-at-castle-hart-review-hallmark-lacey-chabert-stuart-townsend.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchristmas-at-castle-hart-review-hallmark-lacey-chabert-stuart-townsend.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cece-winans.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cece-winans.html>Cece Winans</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-is-akons-real-name.html>What is Akons Real Name?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-is-akons-real-name.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
