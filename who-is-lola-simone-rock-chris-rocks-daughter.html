Since he started his career in the 1980s, Lola’s dad has progressively risen to become one of the world’s best-known superstars and is respected for his craft.</strong></p><p><span>Lola Simone Rock is quite famous in America, but her claim to fame solidly rests on her father’s back. Because of how globally recognized her father is, the comedian’s fame has rubbed off on Lola and she is now also the subject of media attention as Chris Rock’s fans all over the world seek to know some more about who his kids are.</span></p><h3><strong>Summary of Lola Simone Rock’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Lola <span>Simone Rock</span></li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 28 June 2002</li><li><strong>Lola Simone Rock’s Age:</strong> 21 years old</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Cancer</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Unmarried</li><li><strong>Lola Simone Rock’s Parents:</strong> Chris Rock and Malaak Compton-Rock</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Zahra Savannah Rock</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being Chris Rock’s daughter</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old is Lola Simone Rock?</strong></h2><p><span>Lola Simone Rock is currently 21 years old. This is because she was born on the 28th of June 2002. According to our findings, she was born in New York, a city in New York State, USA. It is believed that this was where she grew up with her family. However, she and her family also lived in Alpine, a city in New Jersey for some time.</span></p><p>When Lola was born, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">the news of her birth made headlines around the world</a> as different media houses rushed to write about her father’s new child. This was expected considering how popular Chris Rock is on the global stage. Lola’s mother is a woman called Malaak Compton-Rock who happens to be a passionate humanitarian, advocate, and author.</p><p>Lola grew up being shown lots of love by both parents who have openly confessed to being very much in love with their daughter. Also, considering the kind of wealthy and famous family she was born into, it is safe to say that Lola grew up receiving the best care any child can dream of and that money can buy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Rock-kids.jpg><p>To be clear, not much is known about how exactly Lola spent her days as a little girl with her family. However, Chris Rock once hinted <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">during an interview in 2019</a> that he raised her very strictly and this includes smacking and beating her sometimes if need be when she was a child. This, of course, does not mean the comedian hates his daughter. As a matter of fact, he has openly confessed countless times that nothing makes him happier than being her father.</p><h3><strong>She Went To College In France</strong></h3><p>As expected, Lola Simone Rock has had some formal education. However, the details of the schools she attended are quite vague at the moment. The names of the elementary and high schools that she attended have been out of public reach as the details have been kept hidden.</p><p>In June 2020, Lola’s mother Malaak Compton-Rock shared photos of her on Instagram and revealed that Lola had just graduated from high school. However, she did not say what high school Lola attended. Malaak then went on to also reveal that Lola was about to begin university in Europe and was really excited about beginning that new chapter of her life.</p><p>Eventually, in 2021, Lola began to attend a university in Paris, France. Details of the name of the university she is attending and what she is studying in school have been kept a secret but her mother has been excitedly talking about her daughter’s exploits in school. In September 2021, she shared photos on Instagram celebrating her daughter as she began her sophomore year in college.</p><h2><strong>How Many Siblings Does Lola Simone Rock Have?</strong></h2><p>Lola Simone Rock has two siblings.

Both girls have grown into adorable young ladies. But, they have different personalities, according to their father, Chris Rock. The comedian once explained that Lola is the more sensitive and calm one while Zahra is the extrovert who is more like him.</p><p>Perhaps because of her very extroverted nature, Zahra developed a passion for horseback riding from a very early age and has now become an equestrian who is growing into an achiever in the sport. In fact, she has taken part in several competitions and has done well in them. In early 2020, Zahra was unable to compete for about four months following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, she returned to the competition circuit in July 2020 and showed pure class.</p><p>She took part in the <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">HITS-on-the-Hudson equestrian series</a> in Saugerties, New York in early August and placed first, bringing home the coveted first-place ribbons – blue in the U.S. She was also the overall Reserve Champion. She achieved this with her two horses called Sawyer and Colorful. It is clear that Zahra is going to be great as an equestrian as she keeps exploiting her talent on the field.</p><p>Zahra also loves hanging out with other celebrities. She has been pictured with top superstars like Taylor Swift and Cardi B in the past. The equestrian reportedly started to attend her senior year of high school in person in August 2021 after spending nearly two years at home being homeschooled and having virtual classes due to the pandemic.</p><h3><strong>Ntombi</strong><strong>-futhi Samantha</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Ntombi.jpg><ul><li><strong>Full name: </strong>Ntombi-futhi Samantha</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> February 23, 2008,</li><li><strong>Ntombi-futhi Samantha’s Age:</strong> 15 years old</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> South African, American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Pisces</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Unmarried</li><li><strong>Ntombi-futhi Samantha’s Parents:</strong> Malaak Compton-Rock (adopted mother).

Ntombi’s biological parents are Crispen Khanyile and Precious Ndebele, a South African couple. According to some reports, Ntombi started living with Lola and her family in 2008 and was given the same treatment as Chris Rock and Malaak Compton-Rock’s biological kids.</p><p>Ntombi, who was born on February 23, 2008, was just 6 months old when she started to live with Chris Rock’s family and it was thought Rock and his wife had adopted the little girl before letting her live with them. However, in 2015, when Ntombi was already 7 years old, it was revealed that Chris Rock and his wife had not yet legally adopted her. It was found out that even though Ntombi had already spent 7 years with the Rocks, she had not been legally adopted by the couple.</p><p>Some reports claimed that Ntombi was allowed to live in America with the Rocks <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">on a visitor visa</a> that required return to her home country every year for renewal. The news made headlines around the world as some people questioned what right Chris Rock and his family had to bring a little girl into their home without legally adopting her. It was also believed that the girls’ adoption was something only Malaak Compton-Rock wanted because Chris Rock was not very interested in signing the adoption papers to take Ntombi-futhi Samantha into the family.</p><p>The girl’s father later spoke on the matter hinting that he gave out his daughter to Chris Rock’s family because he fell on hard times. He explained that he and Ntombi’s mother were unemployed and were already taking care of two other kids when Ntombi was born. So things were quite tough for them. It is not clear if some money exchanged hands between both families. It is believed that Ntombi has now been fully and legally adopted by Malaak Compton-Rock alone.</p><h2><strong>Lola’s Father is one of the World’s Best-Known Comedians</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Chris-Rock.jpg><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Christopher Julius Rock</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> February 7, 1965</li><li><strong>Chris Rock’s Age:</strong> 58 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Black</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Aquarius</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Divorced</li><li><strong>Chris Rock’s Ex-Wife:</strong> Malaak Compton-Rock</li><li><strong>Chris Rock’s Children:</strong> Zahra Savannah Rock and Lola Simone Rock</li><li><strong>Chris Rock’s Parents:</strong> Rosalie Rock and Julius Rock</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Tony Rock, Kenny Rock, Andi Rock, Andre Rock, Jordan Rock, Charles Rock, Brian Rock</li><li><strong>Chris Rock’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 8 inches</li><li><strong>Chris Rock’s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 178 cm</li><li><strong>Chris Rock’s Weight:</strong> 76 kg</li><li><strong>Chris Rock’s Net Worth:</strong> $60 million</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, producer, and film director</li><li><strong>Chris Rock’s Instagram:</strong> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Chris Rock</a></li><li><strong>Twitter:</strong> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Chris Rock</a></li><li><strong>Facebook:</strong> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Chris Rock</a></li></ul><p>Chris Rock, who was born on February 7, 1965, began to work as a stand-up comic in 1984 in New York City’s Catch a Rising Star, a chain of comedy clubs.

Of course, the reason for this is very obvious. However, it is noteworthy that marrying Chris Rock is not the only thing she has been able to do with her life. As a matter of fact, she is an achiever in her own rights.</p><p>According to our findings, before Malaak Compton-Rock met and married Chris Rock, she had already established a career as a public relations executive who booked celebrities for UNICEF.

According to our findings, they first met each other in a rather unconventional way. Talking about how they met during an interview in 2007, Chris Rock explained that he and some friends decided to crash an awards ceremony in 1994 when it happened. According to him, he and his friends went to the 1994 Essence Awards after a football game. They were not formally invited to the event but they went anyway.</p><p>It was at the event that Rock met his future wife. He revealed that when they first set eyes on each other, they were quite awestruck and eventually. Malaak was working in the publicity department at the event. She later asked Chris Rock for a picture and this got them even more interested in each other. After the event, the two hit it off and started dating shortly after.</p><p>At first, they endured a long-distance relationship because they were working on opposite sides of the USA at the time. While Malaak was working for the UNICEF, Chris Rock, was working on his comedy career on the East Coast, so they were far apart but the lovers continued to pursue the relationship further and eventually got married.&nbsp;In November 1996, Rock and Compton tied the knot as husband and wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Malaak-and-Chris.jpg><h3><strong>Why They Divorced</strong></h3><p>Chris Rock <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">admitted </a>to being the reason why his marriage crashed. He confessed that he had extra-marital affairs with three women, describing them as famous, semi-famous, and shop class. He also claimed that he thought he could get away with bad behavior in his marriage because he was rich and famous. However, his bad ways caught up with him.</p><p>Rock later shocked the world when <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">he filed for divorce</a> in 2014. The news of their impending divorce made lots of headlines around the world. They were married for 19 years before things fell apart.</p><p>The divorce was finalized on August 22, 2016, and they have both gone their separate ways. Both have gone on to find new lovers.</p><h2><strong>Lola Simone Rock Has the Aim of Nurturing Future Leaders</strong></h2><p>As a celebrity child, Lola Simone Rock was born into luxury and could have become a spoilt kid who looks down on other people. However, she is the complete opposite of this. In fact, she has turned out to be an incredibly talented young woman who apparently has a heart of gold. Right from a young age, she developed the urge to help people and it appears that this is something she will be doing for a long time. She has begun to nurse the idea of nurturing future leaders while becoming one herself.</p><p>While in high school, she often organized events for other students and made sure everyone was treated right. In <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">a 2014 interview,</a> Chris Rock himself described Lola as ‘amazing’ and ‘angelic’. He went on to lay out some of the incredible things she was doing for other people despite being so young. He went on to joke that if anyone ever messes with Lola, he would personally grab a gun and shoot the person very publicly.</p><h3><strong>She Attended Jack & Jill of America&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>In a bid to further explore her leadership skills and gear up to achieve her aim of building leaders, Lola Simone Rock attended the Jack & Jill of America, a leadership organization that was created to actually nurture future African-American leaders by strengthening children through leadership development, volunteer service, philanthropic giving, and civic duty.</p><p>Lola attended the Bergen Passaic chapter of Jack & Jill of America and graduated in June 2020. Upon Lola’s graduation, her mother quickly took to Instagram to congratulate her and state just how incredible it was to be involved with the Jack & Jill of America.</p><h3><strong>Lola was Involved in Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF</strong></h3><p>Lola Simone Rock has been involved in the Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF, a fund-raising program for children that is sponsored by the U.S. Fund for UNICEF. The program involves several Halloween-related fund-raising events designed to raise awareness and funds for Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF. According to reports, the program has raised over US$188 million worldwide.</p><p>Chris Rock himself disclosed Lola’s involvement with Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF. He made the disclosure in his 2014 interview where he talked about his daughters. The comedian expressed his deep admiration for Lola’s drive and a deep passion to make the world a better place for others and help people who need help. Apparently, she is able to do all that she does because of how determined she is to get acquire leadership skills and use them to nurture others in the future.</p><p></p><h3><strong>She Volunteers At Old Folks Home</strong></h3><p>Lola Simone Rock has also been involved in volunteering. According to our findings, the young lady occasionally volunteered at old people’s homes to take care of retirees and other old people who needed help. She began doing this while she was still in high school and showed great compassion while at it.</p><p>Chris Rock also made mention of Lola’s volunteering exploits at old people’s homes during his interview, explaining that she amazes him with her compassionate moves and love for other people.</p><h2><strong>Is Lola Simone Rock on Instagram?</strong></h2><p>It appears that Lola Simone Rock is currently not active on Instagram or any social media platform for that matter. A careful investigation shows no record of activity on her part online at the moment. A <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">particular Instagram page</a> has been associated with Lola in the past. However, a quick visit to the Instagram page mentioned showed that there was no content registered there.</p><p>Also, we know that Lola is not active on Instagram at the moment because her mother has never tagged her on the photo-sharing platform even though she posts many photos of Lola from time to time to celebrate her. We figure that if Lola is active on Instagram, her mother would have tagged her in the posts she makes. It is very possible that Lola could make use of Instagram in the near future.</p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h3><strong>Who is Lola Simone Rock?</strong></h3><p>Lola Simone Rock is the daughter of Chris Rock, an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, producer, and film director.</p><h3><strong>Where is Lola Simone Rock From?</strong></h3><p>Lola Simone Rock is an American.
