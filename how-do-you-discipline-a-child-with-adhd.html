When parents learn about ADHD and which parenting approaches work best, they can help kids improve and do well.<h2>What discipline works for ADHD?</h2>Often, the best way to discipline a child with ADHD is via a simple program of behavior modification: Define age-appropriate, attainable goals and then systematically reward each small achievement until the behavior becomes routine.<h2>How To Discipline A Kid With ADHD</h2><p></p><h2>What should you not say to a child with ADHD?</h2><ul><li>“Having ADHD isn't an excuse.” ...</li><li>“Everyone gets distracted sometimes.” ...</li><li>“ADHD will make you more creative.” ...</li><li>“If you can focus on fun things, you can focus on work.” ...</li><li>“You'll outgrow ADHD.” ...</li><li>“Nobody needs to know you have ADHD.”</li></ul><h2>What triggers ADHD behavior?</h2>Common triggers include: stress, poor sleep, certain foods and additives, overstimulation, and technology.

When children with ADHD misbehave, it can often be as a result of impulsiveness or inattention.<h2>What to do with a kid who argues about everything?</h2>Make an Appeal rule.<p>Kids need to feel heard, and their opinions should matter.
