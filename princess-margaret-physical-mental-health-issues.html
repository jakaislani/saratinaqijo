She grew up with immense privilege and enjoyed all the luxuries that came with royalty, but was also frustrated by the unique limitations that it placed upon her. Margaret died in 2002 after struggling with health problems for much of her adult life, many of them fueled by the unhappiness that came with the burdens of her circumstances.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The abdication of King Edward VIII began a whirlwind two decades for Margaret</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Four years younger than her sister, Margaret was 6 years old when her uncle, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/edward-viii data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="King Edward VIII" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">King Edward VIII</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/edward-viii-abdicate-throne-wallis-simpson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="abdicated the throne" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">abdicated the throne</a> so that he could marry an American divorcee, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/celebrities/wallis-simpson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Wallis Simpson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Wallis Simpson</a>.

He was 16 years her senior and married with two children, but the two had an instant connection. They grew closer following George’s death and Townsend subsequently divorced his wife later in 1952, intent on marrying Margaret.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">They were seen together at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/queen-elizabeth-coronation-photos data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elizabeth’s coronation in 1953" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Elizabeth’s coronation in 1953</a>, and he indeed proposed that same year. She instantly accepted, but the same staid tradition that forced her uncle to abdicate the throne delayed any hope of marriage. Not only was she required to receive permission from Elizabeth under the Royal Marriages Act 1772, but the Church of England also would not bless any royal union with a divorcee if their ex-partner was still living. Elizabeth asked them to wait for a time and Townsend was sent off to Brussels. When he returned in 1955, Margaret no longer needed her sister’s permission to wed but felt duty-bound to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/31/newsid_3202000/3202307.stm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="call off the engagement" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">call off the engagement</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The princess was devastated by the decision, which hardly felt like one made of her own free will; had she married Townsend, she would have had to rescind all her rights as a royal, just like her uncle had done. Given all the tumult around the crown at the time, it wasn’t really an option.</p><img alt="Queen Elizabeth II (L) and Princess Margaret arriving by carriage at Horse Guards Parade, London in May 1993" title="Queen Elizabeth II (L) and Princess Margaret arriving by carriage at Horse Guards Parade, London in May 1993" width=4096 height=2731 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-830585056.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Martin Keene - PA Images/PA Images via Getty Images</span><p>Queen Elizabeth II (L) and Princess Margaret arriving by carriage at Horse Guards Parade, London in May 1993</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Margaret spent the ‘60s and ‘70s drinking, smoking and increasingly suffering</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Five years later, Margaret married a celebrity photographer named <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/lord-snowdon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Antony Armstrong-Jones" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Antony Armstrong-Jones</a>, the first royal marriage to be broadcast on live television.

Theirs was a true affection, but their personalities and backgrounds increasingly brought them into conflict and their marriage began its slow downward trajectory in the late ‘60s.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lord Snowdon began avoiding the spotlight, working endless hours in his role as the art director of The Sunday Times, and treating Margaret with increasing cruelty. Both initiated extramarital affairs; Margaret began seeing a Scottish writer named Robin Douglas-Home, while Lord Snowdon had a series of indiscretions while on the road for work. The press began reporting on their troubles in 1967, which led to an attempt to reconcile, but it was of little use.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">They continued to drift, and Margaret began an affair with Roderic Llewellyn, a man 18 years her junior, in 1973. Llewellyn joined her on trips to the Caribbean island of Mustique. It was on that island that Margaret was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/princess-margaret-was-suicidal-before-divorce-1.22168 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said to have a nervous breakdown" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said to have a nervous breakdown</a> in 1974, which allegedly led to friends and family having her room bugged.

After word of her relationship with Llewellyn made the tabloids, in 1976, Margaret and Lord Snowdon officially separated.

Just as her love life was limited by her predecessors, Margaret’s decision to dissolve her own marriage later opened doors for later generations of British royals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That same year, Margaret began what would turn out to be 25 years of sporadic illness and tragic decline.

Hepatitis returned in 1984 and Margaret underwent emergency lung surgery in 1985 when doctors <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://apnews.com/article/f4db21cdfe92ea3e9f01c98d3822d169 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="removed part of her left lung" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">removed part of her left lung</a> after more than 30 years of smoking. She was lucky to not have a malignant tumor like King George had suffered, but the parallels with her beloved father were there for all to see.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The princess allegedly gave up smoking for a time after the operation, but was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/04/03/Princess-Margaret-cant-kick-smoking-habit/5236481352400/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="right back to it three months later" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">right back to it three months later</a>, returning to a relatively tamer habit of 30 cigarettes a day. Then she was said to have increased her smoking habit back to its peak once she was persuaded to retire her infamous penchant for drinking whiskey.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Unfortunately, the many years of hard living made for a sad final decade for the princess. In 1992, she had to cancel engagements and was hospitalized for a fever, and in 1993, she was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.deseret.com/1993/1/5/19025221/princess-margaret-has-a-bout-of-pneumonia data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hospitalized with pneumonia" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">hospitalized with pneumonia</a>, That incident finally induced Margaret to kick cigarettes for good.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Margaret <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/25/world/princess-margaret-has-a-mild-stroke.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="suffered a stroke in 1998" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">suffered a stroke in 1998</a> while vacationing in Mustique, the vacation retreat that became something of a house of horrors.

Further, a spokesman for the Mustique Company, which operated the island, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/princess-margaret-suffers-stroke-on-holiday-island-1146772.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="promised in a press statement" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">promised in a press statement</a> that Margaret “was able to walk from her car across the Tarmac to the plane” and that “she was also sitting on the plane, there was no need for a stretcher."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Still, the stroke would inaugurate five years of ongoing health crises.

The Telegraph suggested she’d had a delayed reaction to the hot water due to her having Raynaud's Disease, a circulatory disease sometimes caused by smoking. She was bedridden for a while as she recovered, though the palace disputed reports that she’d been hospitalized in serious condition. Still, from that point forward, Margaret would generally be <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=81805&page=1" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="seen in a wheelchair" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">seen in a wheelchair</a> during her rare public appearances.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The next few years were marked by solemn reports of medical distress in both the serious newspapers and the tabloids, which tended to dramatize the incidents.
