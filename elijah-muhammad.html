D. Fard, founder of the black separatist movement Nation of Islam (NOI). Muhammad became Fard’s successor from 1934 until his death in 1975 and was known for his controversial preaching. His followers included <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/malcolm-x data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Malcolm X" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Malcolm X</a> and Louis Farrakhan.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years and Family</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Elijah Muhammad was born Elijah Robert Poole in Sandersville, Georgia, on October 7, 1897. He was one of 13 children of William and Mariah (Hall) Poole. His father was a sharecropper and his mother was a domestic worker. He grew up in Cordele, Georgia, where he attended school only through the fourth grade and dropped out to begin working in sawmills and brickyards. At an early age, he witnessed extreme prejudice and violence toward blacks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He married Clara Evans in 1919 and eventually had eight children with her. In 1923, seeking better employment and a more tolerant environment, he moved his own family, parents and siblings to Detroit, Michigan, where he worked in an auto factory.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Joining the Nation of Islam</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Then known by his birth name of Elijah Robert Poole, Muhammad in 1931 met Wallace D. Fard, a former salesman preaching a new form of Islam tailored to the needs and problems of black Americans. Poole converted and adopted the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and Fard gave him a new name, Elijah Muhammad.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Some of Fard’s doctrines, such as a cosmology that identified blacks as the original race and white people as “devils” created later by a mad scientist named Yakub, are still difficult to interpret. Other teachings, such as self-reliance, clean living and the promise of a future in which Black people would no longer be oppressed, had obvious appeal for Muhammad and other Black Muslims.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">NOI Leadership</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When Fard mysteriously disappeared in 1934, the Nation of Islam split into several rival factions. Muhammad moved a group of followers to Chicago, where he established Temple of Islam No. 2 as the new headquarters of the religion. There he began to spread the word of the NOI, slowly but steadily attracting new members.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Muhammad was imprisoned from 1942 to 1946 for evading the draft. After his release, he returned to leadership of the Nation of Islam. He declared that Fard had been an incarnation of Allah and that he himself was now Allah’s messenger.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Over the next 30 years, Muhammad built the religion from a small fringe group into a large and complex organization that attracted controversy along with its new prominence. He continued to preach financial independence for Black Americans, racial separation rather than integration, and a strict code of moral behavior.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The movement's rise was boosted by Malcolm X, who began communicating with Muhammad while incarcerated and became his most prominent apostle in the 1950s. However, Malcolm X left the NOI by 1964 over disagreements with its leader.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Quotes and Books</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A charismatic speaker, Muhammad was unyielding in his criticism of white oppression. "They say that I am a preacher of racial hatred," he once said, "but the fact is that the white people don't like the truth, especially if it speaks against them. It is a terrible thing for such people to charge me with teaching race hatred when their feet are on my people's neck and they tell us to our face that they hate black people." He later toned down his rhetoric, noting shortly before his death that "the slavemaster is no longer hindering us, we're hindering ourselves."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Muhammad also wrote several books, including Message to the Blackman in America (1965) and How to Eat to Live (1967). Other books attributed to him, like The God-Science of Black Power (2002), consisting of his speeches and lectures.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death and Legacy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When Muhammad died of congestive heart failure on February 25, 1975, he left behind a thriving religious movement with a membership as high as 250,000. Its social and political influence was matched by the success of its financial enterprises: real estate holdings, a national newspaper called Muhammad Speaks and numerous independent businesses.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Muhammad was succeeded by his son Warith Deen Mohammed, whose attempts to reform the doctrines championed by his father drew a mixed response. As a result, another prominent leader, Louis Farrakhan, branched out to form his own version of the NOI in 1978.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><ul data-node-id=24 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Muhammad</li><li>Birth Year: 1897</li><li>Birth date: October 7, 1897</li><li>Birth State: Georgia</li><li>Birth City: Sandersville</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Elijah Muhammad rose from poverty to become the charismatic leader of the black nationalist group Nation of Islam, and mentor of Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Civil Rights</li><li>Islam</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Libra</li><li>Death Year: 1975</li><li>Death date: February 25, 1975</li><li>Death State: Illinois</li><li>Death City: Chicago</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=27><ul data-node-id=29 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Elijah Muhammad Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/activists/elijah-muhammad</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: May 6, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=32 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Don't condemn if you see a person has a dirty glass of water, just show them the clean glass of water that you have.
