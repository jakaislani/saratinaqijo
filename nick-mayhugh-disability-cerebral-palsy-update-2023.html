Not until 2010—following a hospitalization and grand mal seizure—was the true reason behind Nick’s difficulties identified. A dead spot on the right side of his brain, a permanent result of a stroke he had suffered in utero, was discovered during extensive testing and scans.</p><p>The numbness, impaired motor function, and lack of sensation that largely affected his left arm, hand, and leg were ultimately explained by this realization. This is when Nick was officially diagnosed with cerebral palsy.</p><p>Nick Mayhugh’s story demonstrates his tenacity and willpower.
