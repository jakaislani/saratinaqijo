He was born to John Fury and Amber Fury.</p><p>He was born one pound underweight and three months early (450 g). Fury was raised in Styal, Cheshire, and would later frequently express his affection for both Styal and Manchester, the city where he was born. His father was also born in Tuam, where his paternal grandfather was from.</p><p>The Furys, who take their current surname from Fiodhabhra, are ultimately of Gaelic descent. His mother was born in Belfast, while his maternal grandmother comes from County Tipperary.</p><p>Despite strongly identifying with his Irish heritage, Fury has had to obtain dual citizenship because, in the 1960s, Irish Travelers only registered births through baptism with the church rather than formally with the state, hence his father’s birth in County Galway was not civilly recorded.</p><p>When he was 11 years old, Fury dropped out of school to work the roads with his father and three brothers. Only four of the 14 children his mother Amber carried to term survived. Ramona, a girl, was born in December 1997 but passed away soon after. Fury, who was just nine years old at the time, has continued to think about this incident. At the age of ten, Fury started boxing.</p><p>Up until 2011, when John was imprisoned for gouging out the eye of another Traveller as a result of a protracted dispute, his father had been training him. Prior to his bout against Wladimir Klitschko, Fury’s other uncle Peter Fury (the trainer of his son Hughie Fury) coached him. Hughie Fury trained him up until his death in 2014, at which point Peter Fury took over.</p><p>Peter Fury, a former boxer who was previously sentenced to ten years in prison in 1995, started an amphetamine trafficking network in North West England and continued to run it while he was imprisoned. Fury hasn’t run into any legal issues personally.</p><p>Boxing has a lengthy history with the Fury family. In the 1980s, Fury’s father competed as “Gypsy” John Fury, first as an unlicensed, bare-knuckle boxer and later as a professional boxer.</p><p>John had an 8-4-1 professional record, with one defeat coming at the hands of Henry Akinwande, the eventual WBO heavyweight world champion. On December 22, 2018, Tommy, Tyson’s half-brother, made his professional debut under the guidance of two-weight world champion Ricky Hatton.</p><p>Fury is also related to boxers Hughie Fury and Nathan Gorman, both heavyweights, Andy Lee, a former middleweight world champion, and Hosea Burton, a potential light heavyweight contender.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tyson Fury age</h2><p>Fury was born in 1988, hence he is currently 34 years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tyson Fury height</h2><p>Fury stands at a height of 2.06 m and weighs 120kg.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tyson Fury career</h2><p>The WBC title, which he has held since defeating Deontay Wilder in 2020, and The Ring magazine title, which he held from August 2020 to August 2022, make him a two-time world heavyweight champion. Before that, he held the unified WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, IBO, and The Ring titles after defeating Wladimir Klitschko in 2015.</p><p>Fury is largely regarded by media sources as the lineal heavyweight champion after his victory against Wilder made him the third heavyweight, after Floyd Patterson and Muhammad Ali, to hold The Ring magazine championship twice.</p><p>According to ESPN, Fury is the best active heavyweight in the world as of August 2022. He is also ranked sixth by the TBRB, seventh by the Boxing Writers Association of America, and fourth greatest active fighter, pound-for-pound, by ESPN.</p><p>He was 20 years old when he won the ABA super-heavyweight championship in 2008, and he later became pro. He twice held the English heavyweight championship before defeating 14-0 Derek Chisora in 2011 to capture the British and Commonwealth titles.</p><p>Before defeating Chisora once more in a rematch for the European and WBO International heavyweight belts in 2014, he first won the Irish and WBO Inter-Continental titles. With this victory and his 24-0 record, Fury was given the opportunity to fight Wladimir Klitschko, the long-reigning heavyweight champion, in Germany. Fury won the bout by unanimous decision.</p><p>Ten days after the Klitschko fight, Fury was stripped of his IBF title because a rematch provision in his contract with Klitschko prevented him from agreeing to a fight with the IBF’s mandatory challenger, Vyacheslav Glazkov.</p><p>Due to Fury’s mental health difficulties, which included alcoholism, recreational drug use, and excessive weight gain, a rematch was not held. He gave up the WBA, WBO, and IBO belts in 2016, and The Ring stripped him of his final title in the beginning of 2018. After more than two years of inactivity, Fury challenged Wilder for the WBC heavyweight championship later that year.</p><p>In the rematch in February 2020, Fury outclassed Wilder and won via technical knockout in the seventh round. In the trilogy bout in October 2021, he once more defeated Wilder by knockout, this time in the eleventh round.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tyson Fury parents</h2><p>Fury was born to John Fury and Amer Fury.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tyson Fury wife</h2><p>Fury is married to Paris Fury.
