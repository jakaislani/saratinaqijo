She was a hit in Europe as a performer to classical music and opened schools that integrated dance with other types of learning. She later faced immense tragedy with the death of her children and spouse's suicide.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Childhood</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With accounts varying, Isadora Angela Duncan was born circa May 26, 1877 (the date on her baptismal certificate; some sources say May 27, 1878), in San Francisco, California. Her parents divorced when Duncan was an infant, and she was raised by her mother, Dora, a piano teacher with a great appreciation for the arts. At the age of 6, Duncan began to teach movement to little children in her neighborhood; word spread, and by the time she was 10, her classes had become quite large. She requested to leave public school so that she, along with older sister Elizabeth, could earn income from teaching. Duncan subsequently received tutelage from poet Ina Coolbrith.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Success in Europe</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Duncan lived in Chicago and New York before moving to Europe. There with brother Raymond she studied Greek mythology and visual iconography, which would inform her sensibilities and general style of movement as an artist. Duncan came to look at ancient rituals around dance, nature and the body as being central to her performance ideology.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Barefoot and clad in sheaths inspired by Greek imagery and Italian Renaissance paintings, Duncan danced her own choreography in the homes of the financially elite before becoming a major success in Budapest, Hungary, having a sold-out run of shows in 1902.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She embarked on successful tours, becoming a European sensation honored not only by enraptured audiences, but by fellow artists who captured her image in painting, sculpture and poetry. Duncan's style was controversial for its time, as it defied what she viewed as the constricting conventions of ballet, placing major emphasis on the human female form and free-flowing moves. Duncan's achievements and artistic vision would lead her to be called the "Mother of Modern Dance"â€”a moniker also shared by a successor of sorts, Martha Graham.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Schools and 'Isadorables'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Duncan defied social custom in other ways and was viewed as an early feminist, declaring that she wouldn't marry and thus having two children out of wedlock. Duncan also founded dance schools in the United States, Germany and Russia, with her dance students dubbed the "Isadorables" by the media. She developed a particularly affinity for the latter country and its revolutionary movements, and in the early 1920s received patronage from Vladimir Lenin for her teaching work.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Difficult Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Duncan faced horrific tragedies in her life, with her two children and their nanny drowning in 1913 when the car they were in fell into the Seine River. Later, Duncan married poet Sergey Aleksandrovich Yesenin in 1922, favoring a legal union to allow him travel to the United States. However, the couple was ostracized due to anti-Bolshevik paranoia, and Duncan declared that she would not return to America. The marriage wouldn't last, with Yesenin suffering from severe mental health issues and committing suicide in the mid-1920s.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Duncan struggled emotionally during her later years. She died in Nice, France, on September 14, 1927, when her scarf got caught in the back wheels of an automobile in which she was riding.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The same year of her death, Duncan's autobiography was published, My Life, which has gone on to become a critically acclaimed work. Over the years, many other books, along with several films, have offered accounts on Duncan's life and art.</p><ul data-node-id=22 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Isadora Duncan</li><li>Birth Year: 1877</li><li>Birth date: May 26, 1877</li><li>Birth State: California</li><li>Birth City: San Francisco</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Isadora Duncan was a trailblazing dancer and instructor whose emphasis on freer forms of movement was a precursor to modern dance techniques.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Art</li><li>Writing and Publishing</li><li>Music</li><li>Theater and Dance</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Gemini</li><li>Death Year: 1927</li><li>Death date: September 14, 1927</li><li>Death City: Nice</li><li>Death Country: France</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=25><ul data-node-id=27 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Isadora Duncan Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/artists/isadora-duncan</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: July 28, 2020</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=30 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>My art is just an effort to express the truth of my Being in gesture and movement.
